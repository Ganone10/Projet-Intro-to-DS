# Portfolio Strategy with CAC40 Stocks

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to design a portfolio investment strategy focusing on CAC40 stocks. The primary objective is to construct a benchmark portfolio based on the market capitalization of these stocks. Subsequently, we will explore more advanced strategies in a later part of the project.

### I.I Market Cap Benchmark

#### I.I.1 Library and Import Data
The initial step involves importing specific libraries required for our analysis. Once the necessary libraries are installed, we will proceed to import the relevant data necessary for our study.

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install RStudio**: Ensure that you have RStudio installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

2. **Open R Notebook**: Open the provided R notebook file (`portfolio_strategy.Rmd`) in RStudio.

3. **Run Code Cells**: Execute the code cells sequentially by clicking on the "Run" button or pressing Shift + Enter. Make sure to install any required R packages mentioned in the notebook before running the code.

4. **Review Outputs**: After running the code cells, review the outputs, visualizations, and any generated analysis within the notebook.

5. **Explore Advanced Strategies**: Continue exploring the notebook for more advanced strategies and analysis beyond the market cap benchmark.
